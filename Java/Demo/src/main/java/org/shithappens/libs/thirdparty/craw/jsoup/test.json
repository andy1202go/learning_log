In this case, we add a day to the estimated date. Some courier partners and Sellers do not work on Sundays and this is factored in to the delivery dates. \n\n __Why does the estimated delivery time vary for each seller?__ \n\n You have probably noticed varying estimated delivery times for Sellers of the product you are interested in.

Why?__ \n\n Enter your pincode on the product page (you don't have to enter it every single time) to know whether the product can be delivered to your location. \n\n If you haven't provided your pincode until the checkout stage, the pincode in your last used shipping address will be used to check for serviceability. \n\n Whether your location can be serviced or not depends on:\n\n * Whether the Seller actually ships to your location \n * Legal restrictions, if any, in shipping particular products to your location \n * The availability of reliable courier partners in your location \n\n At times Sellers prefer not to ship to certain locations. This is entirely at their discretion.\n\n More answers in our <a href='/pages/shipping' target='_blank'>Shipping FAQs »</a>",
