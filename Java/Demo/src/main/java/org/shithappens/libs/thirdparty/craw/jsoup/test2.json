In this case, we add a day to the estimated date. Some courier partners and Sellers do not work on Sundays and this is factored in to the delivery dates. \n\n __Why does the estimated delivery time vary for each seller?__ \n\n You have probably noticed varying estimated delivery times for Sellers of the product you are interested in.

Why?__ \n\n Enter your pincode on the product page (you don't have to enter it every single time) to know whether the product can be delivered to your location. \n\n If you haven't provided your pincode until the checkout stage, the pincode in your last used shipping address will be used to check for serviceability. \n\n Whether your location can be serviced or not depends on:\n\n * Whether the Seller actually ships to your location \n * Legal restrictions, if any, in shipping particular products to your location \n * The availability of reliable courier partners in your location \n\n At times Sellers prefer not to ship to certain locations. This is entirely at their discretion.\n\n More answers in our <a href='/pages/shipping' target='_blank'>Shipping FAQs »</a>",

If the seller details do not call this out, it indicates that the seller does not currently provide this service.\r\n\r\n1.  **What are the details I should carefully enter while filling out my GST details?** \r\n\r\n  While entering the GST details ensure that the GST number mentioned is valid and active, belongs to the same state as that of the delivery address and also ensure that you mention the exact name of your registered business.\r\n\r\n1.  **What happens if I fill incorrect details?**\r\n\r\n  Please note that in case incorrect GST details are provided during order placement, the order will be automatically cancelled.\r\n\r\n1.  **My order is eligible for the GST Invoice but why am I not shown this option during order placement?**\r\n\r\n  An order is not eligible for GST Invoice option if value added services/plans/exchange offers are part of the order. You can choose to remove such plans from your order to ensure that your order is eligible for GST Invoice option.\r\n\r\n1.  **Can I get GST Invoice for installation/service/demo that will be charged by the brand after the delivery?**\r\n\r\n  If the delivery/installation/demo amount is charged by the brand, it is not included in the order invoice issued by the seller. Hence, it is not eligible for GST Invoice.\r\n\r\n1.  **What should I do if I missed sharing my GST details / provided incorrect details on the invoice?**\r\n\r\n  The GST related details as provided by the customers are automatically captured and printed on the invoice. Hence, this cannot be changed once the order has been placed. In case you entered the wrong GST details while placing the order, you can choose to cancel it and place a fresh order with the correct details.\r\n\r\n1.  **Can I get my invoice modified?**\r\n\r\n  The seller does not have the option to modify sections of the order invoice once it's generated.\r\n\r\n1.  **If I had entered my GST details while placing an earlier order, do I have to mention it again for the next orders I place?**\r\n\r\n  Please note that the GST details have to be entered each time you place an order for an eligible product in order to receive GST Invoice.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Terms of Use]: https://www.flipkart.com/pages/terms"

I'm a heavy user I'm getting more than 16+ hours of battery.. if you are medium user you will get atleast 18-19+ hours.. sound quality was awesome.. earphones are also good.. highlight was ram you can expand till 19 gb and space was 256gb it's like mini computer you can use.. display and everything was awesome no need to think..if you are budget is 35-40k you can choose this..if you exchange your mobile you can get good discount.. like I did I just upgraded my mobile from oppo f9 pro to reno 6 pro I got it in below 30k..",

I suggest you buy the Aurora color version blindly if you're confused with colors.\n\n2) In-hand feel - 5/5  - Smooth & light. The back material is amazing. It gives a smooth & rich in-hand experience.\n\n3) Camera & Video - 4/5 - Awesome. The Bokeh Flare Portrait video effect will encourage you to make more videos. Camera quality is good.\n\n4) Processor and speed - 4/5- Mediatek 1200 is good but too early to say with a few day use. Still, I would like to add that I faced annoying message that device will turn of hotspot automatically when I tried doing multiple job at a time at normal room temperature. I believe oppo 5 also has same problem to avoid heating issue.\n\n5) OS & connectivity - 5/5 -It's good. No spammy ads. 11 5G band is no joke. Claps for so many bands. \n\n6) Battery & Charging - 5/5 - The real beast in the segment. 65W is doing its job pretty well. Battery isn't drying rapidly like other phones. It's long lasting.\n\n7) Display - 4/5 It's nice to have curve & quality material that gives a good touch feel, but I would be more happy if the device could have offered 800 nits/90hz.\n\n8) Worth to Price? - Nopes - It could be a big hit if price range was in between 33-35k, instead 40k. But, this is the checkbox where every premium device fails.",

Wonderful camera with good low light pics.\n3. Premium display\n4. Fast charging works really, nearly as fast as claimed. 35mins for full charge.\n5. I display finger print scanner and face unlock are flawless.\n6. Processor is works pretty fast.\n7. Over all a well optimized eco system, gives excellent performance.\n\nCons...\n1. Call recording thru Google dialer (gives warning on call recording to other party) and also doesn't work on while on WiFi calling. Big downer..\n\n2. Google Chrome doesn't work as fast as it should, need better optimization.\n\n3. Unable to share YouTube videos link on WhatsApp while playing YouTube video in floating window.\n\nOverall a good flagship killer though a little overpriced. Go for it.....",

                      "text": "Great phone. Great UI as well. If color os is what confuses you, you don't have to worry. It's very smooth and highly customisable. If you love tweaking your phone you'd like playing around with all the customisation settings. Apart from the few built in bloatware (you can uninstall these) I haven't noticed any adds or promotions. Someone could take notes (ahem *MiUI* ahem)\n\nThe camera performance is great under natural lighting. The camera app needs some improvement. It's good for the price. However the macro camera is for namesake alone. You'd get better shots simply by zooming in than using the so-called macro. The front camera gets the job done, don't expect more. The portrait does work and comes out well 8/10 times as long as you don't overdo it. The Bokeh flare option is good if you like experimenting, but nothing more.\n\nThe only con I would say is that the battery life drains quite a bit if you're a heavy user. Under normal usage it can last you a whole day without worries. The charging is extremely fast so it's really a big deal at the end of the day.\n\nThe phone looks extremely sleek and premium without a case. Oppo has nailed it in terms of looks. The stellar black colour however seems to have a blue undertone that gets visible as the angles shift. So yeah just be aware that it's not true dark black as such.\n\nGaming performance as been extremely smooth and lag free. 12gb of ram is more than enough and there's ram expansion of top of it. Pubg(the *Highest* graphics settings isn't supported but yeah), COD and asphalt 9 all run great at high graphics.\n\nCall quality from the earpiece is also very clear and sufficiently loud. The main speaker however could have been louder. This too is a con I'd point out. Cranking up the volume would take care of this, but yeah notifications sounds aren't loud enough unless the volume is pretty high. The earphones provided are pretty good.\n\nThe fingerprint sensor is not the fastest I've seen but it does get the job done. It's not annoyingly slow either so it's not really an issue. You do notice a small delay but I'm just nitpicking\nI honestly never thought I'd get myself an oppo device, but yeah I'm pretty satisfied. I chose this over the OnePlus 8T and it hasn't been disappointing. For the price it's a great phone and a good option to consider especially since OnePlus is not living up to their reputation anymore.",
